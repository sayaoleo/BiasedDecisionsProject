ABI Tool Manual

Pre-requisites to use the ABI Tool:

1) For financial values never write "," nor ".".
Besides digits from 0 to 9, it is only allowed to enter the signal "-" in the front of the number when it is a negative number, such as,
-95000. When it is a positive number, just type the digits 0 to 9, such as , 95000.

2) If there is an alternative with 100% chance, it should be the first alternative to be input into the system.

3) If there are more than on alternative with 100% chance, the order does not matter since item 2 is satisfied.

4) If there is an alternative composed by 2 statements joined with "AND" (conjunction) and each statement has its
financial value with its respective probability then the statement with the greatest probability should be input the first into the system.
Example of an alternative like that: 95% chance of losing US$10000 AND 5% chance of losing US$100.
